Especially once students are already in university, safety is often discussed big-picture. It's not uncommon to hear platitudes like \"Columbus Ave is sketchy at night\". Our project aims to quantitatively explore crime and safety on Northeastern University's campus by analyzing data from the Northeastern University Police Department incident reports. \r\n\r\n### Data Collection\r\nHuntington News, Northeastern's campus paper, publishes a weekly \"Crime Log\" with select incident reports throughout the week. These are available [online](http://huntnewsnu.com/category/crime-log/) dating back to 2002. Initially, we intended to scrape the data off Northeastern's website, but we quickly scrapped that idea due to the inconsistent formatting and difficulty involved in accurately parsing the logs. \r\nWe decided to reach out to NUPD and request a digital copy of the data. After an office visit and a few not-so-frictionless phone calls, they sent over incident reports from 1st Jan 2016 to  2nd Dec 2016. \r\nThe reports were in a pdf, which we used [tabula](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula) and a python script to extract into a usable CSV. \r\n\r\n### Incidents\r\nThe first thing we explored was the different _types_ of incident reports. \r\n```{r}\r\ntab <- table(logs$INCIDENT)\r\nlogsCorpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(logs$INCIDENT))\r\nlogsCorpus <- tm_map(logsCorpus, PlainTextDocument)\r\npng(\"wordcloud.png\", width=1280,height=800)\r\nwordcloud(names(tab),as.numeric(tab),scale = c(1, 0.5), random.order = FALSE, colors=brewer.pal(9, \"Set1\"))\r\n```\r\n![Incidents](http://i.imgur.com/SVl5UPD.png)\r\n\r\nWe were surprised to see how precise these incident reports were, as we found a count of 132 unique incidents reported on campus in 2016. Some of the most frequent reports were incidents regarding suspicious activity, well being or people on campus, medical, drugs, and larceny. \r\n```{r}\r\ndtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(logsCorpus)\r\nm <- as.matrix(dtm)\r\ntab <- sort(tab, decreasing = TRUE)\r\nd <- data.frame(freq=tab)\r\nhead(d, 133)\r\n```\r\n```               \r\n1                   SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY - SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY       750\r\n2                                           MEDICAL - MEDICAL       535\r\n3                               WELL BEING - WELL BEING CHECK       244\r\n4                       ALCOHOL INVOLVED - INTOXICATED PERSON       206\r\n5                           LARCENY - LARCENY - FROM BUILDING       199\r\n6                                   OAA - OTHER - OAA - OTHER       190\r\n7                      MOTOR VEHICLE - MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT        96\r\n8                        DRUGS - MARIJUANA, SUSPICIOUS OF USE        83\r\n9                                     NOISE - NOISE COMPLAINT        71\r\n10                                         FRAUD - FRAUD/SCAM        69\r\n11                           WELL BEING - ELEVATOR ENTRAPMENT        66\r\n12                            PROPERTY - CONFISCATED PROPERTY        63\r\n13               MOTOR VEHICLE - OAA - MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT        59\r\n14                    SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY - DISORDERLY PERSON        54\r\n15                                LARCENY - LARCENY - BICYCLE        48\r\n16                     MV VIOLATION - MOTOR VEHICLE VIOLATION        47\r\n17                     DRUGS - MARIJUANA, LESS THAN ONE OUNCE        40\r\n18                            LARCENY - LARCENY - SHOPLIFTING        36\r\n19            SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY - OAA - SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY        34\r\n20           MOTOR VEHICLE - MV STOP - PUBLIC SAFETY PURPOSES        32\r\n```\r\nAn unexpected observation we found was that there was a high number of incidents of “Well Being - Elevator Entrapment.” We did not expect this at all, and it seems that it was reported so commonly that it had received its own incident name, as opposed to being categorized under “Well Being Check.” \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, at the bottom of the list there were few incidents regarding aggravated assault and sex crimes, which was a bit surprising. \r\n```\r\n122                   MISSING PERSON - MISSING PERSON - FOUND         1\r\n123                MOTOR VEHICLE - MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT - AUTO         1\r\n124                                        NOISE - LOUD PARTY         1\r\n125                          PROPERTY DAMAGE - OAA - GRAFFITI         1\r\n126              ROBBERY - OAA - NU - ROBBERY - ARMED - KNIFE         1\r\n127            SEX CRIME - OAA - LEWD AND LASCIVIOUS BEHAVIOR         1\r\n128                  SEX CRIME - OAA - NU - SEXUAL HARASSMENT         1\r\n129                    SEX CRIME - OAA - TOUCHING AND GROPING         1\r\n130          SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY - OAA - INVESTIGATE PREMISES         1\r\n131                              WEAPONS - FIREARMS VIOLATION         1\r\n132                               WEAPONS - WEAPONS VIOLATION         1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to a study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, about 21% of undergraduate females had come across sexual assault some time in their college life. However, this crime log data shows that there were few reports of sex crimes, which could mean that many people are afraid to speak up about it. In an [article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/11/03/student-sues-northeastern-over-handling-sexual-assault-case/3pGiXpweQ3VXkDgRUMrYiM/story.html) by the Boston Globe, Mark F. Itzkowitz, an attorney for an alleged sex crime victim, had said that sex crimes were under-reported on the Northeastern University campus. \r\n\r\n### Locations\r\nNext, we had looked into which areas on campus had reported more or less crimes. \r\n![Locations](http://i.imgur.com/YiKA9jQ.png)\r\n\r\nWe saw that over the past year, there were 208 different locations that had reported incidents, but most of the incidents were reported off campus, which had reported almost three times the amount of the second-most reported area, Columbus Place. \r\n```\r\n1                      OFF CAMPUS       325\r\n2                  COLUMBUS PLACE       112\r\n3                   MARINO CENTER       110\r\n4               HUNTINGTON AVENUE       108\r\n5                 COLUMBUS AVENUE        99\r\n6                     SPEARE HALL        97\r\n7    INT'L VILLAGE EAST RESIDENCE        84\r\n8            CURRY STUDENT CENTER        73\r\n9            RUGGLES MBTA STATION        63\r\n10                 TREMONT STREET        62\r\n11                  SNELL LIBRARY        61\r\n12                 FORSYTH STREET        57\r\n13                           YMCA        57\r\n14                   STETSON WEST        56\r\n15                HEMENWAY STREET        53\r\n16                   EAST VILLAGE        52\r\n17            ST. STEPHENS STREET        52\r\n18                   STETSON EAST        52\r\n19                     WHITE HALL        52\r\n20                    CARTER PARK        50\r\n21                 MATTHEWS ARENA        46\r\n```\r\nWe also found that out of the student dorms, Speare Hall had reported the most crimes. We found that, regarding student dorms, the amount of incidents reported widely varies between each dorm, having found anywhere from 8 reports (Kerr Hall) to 97 reports (Speare Hall)\r\n\r\nWe also made a heatmap to visualize the frequency of specific incidents at the most reported locations. \r\n\r\n```{python}\r\ndf3 = pd.read_csv(\"{CSV FILE}\", sep=\";\")\r\nsplits = df3['INCIDENT'].str.split(' - ')\r\ndf3['INCIDENT_MIN'] = splits.str[0]\r\ndf3 = pd.crosstab(df3['LOCATION'], df3['INCIDENT_MIN'])\r\n\r\ndf3['TOTAL_COL'] = df3.sum(axis=1)\r\ndf3.sort_values(by='TOTAL_COL', axis=0, inplace=True, ascending=False)\r\ndf3 = df3.head(n=25)\r\ndf3.drop('TOTAL_COL', axis=1, inplace=True)\r\n\r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\r\nheatmap = ax.pcolor(df3, cmap=plt.cm.Blues, alpha=5)\r\n\r\nfig = plt.gcf()\r\nax.set_frame_on(False)\r\nax.set_yticks(np.arange(df3.shape[0])+0.5, minor=False)\r\nax.set_xticks(np.arange(df3.shape[1])+0.5, minor=False)\r\nax.set_xticklabels(df3.columns, minor=False)\r\nax.set_yticklabels(df3.index, minor=False)\r\n\r\nax.invert_yaxis()\r\nax.xaxis.tick_top()\r\n\r\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\r\n\r\nax = plt.gca()\r\nfor t in ax.xaxis.get_major_ticks(): \r\n    t.tick1On = False \r\n    t.tick2On = False \r\nfor t in ax.yaxis.get_major_ticks(): \r\n    t.tick1On = False \r\n    t.tick2On = False  \r\n```\r\n\r\n![Heatmap](http://i.imgur.com/yRfn1px.png)\r\n\r\nLarceny, Medical and Suspicious Activity are the most frequent type of incidents across all the locations. \r\nAlso of note, is \"Larceny\" is most frequently reported at Marino Center and Snell Library, which are studying hotspots that are often targets for theft. \r\n\r\n### Time\r\nWe also looked at _when_ these reports occur\r\nFirst, we looked at frequency at each hour over the day.\r\n\r\n```{python}\r\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"{CSV_FILE}\", sep=\";\", parse_dates=['DATE'], date_parser=date_parser)\r\ndf = df.set_index(pd.DatetimeIndex(df['DATE']))\r\nfreq_hour = df.resample('H').count()\r\nfreq_hour\r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)\r\nax.plot(freq_hour['DATE'])\r\nax.xaxis_date()\r\nfig.autofmt_xdate()\r\n```\r\n![Frequency Day](http://i.imgur.com/psVItBj.png)\r\n\r\nAs expected, the \"busiest\" hours are at night, starting around 10PM and peaking at 1AM, with a steady drop until the early morning, which boasts the least number of reports.\r\n\r\nWe also looked at daily number of reports over the entire year\r\n![Frequency Year](http://i.imgur.com/XuLzU4g.png)\r\n\r\nThere's a huge spike in reports around the end of March/Beginning of April, which we thought might align with the nice weather and the end of midterm season. \r\nThere's a lull in the summer, as there's usually less people on campus around that time. Another spike occurs at the beginning of the semester around September, when everyone is back on campus. \r\n\r\n### Disposition\r\n![Disposition](http://i.imgur.com/ZTvJe3S.png)\r\nWe had found that there were only 19 dispositions regarding the incidents. The overwhelming majority of dispositions had been under either “Report filed” or “Services Rendered/No Report.” This shows us that most of the incidents reported are actually no big deal and can be dealt with very easily. There were also a low number of arrests made by the Boston Police Department at Northeastern, and an even lower amount of incidents that had been closed by state police, which is to be expected. We had found it surprising that there were almost 300 incidents that had nothing filed under “Disposition.”\r\n\r\n### Challenges\r\nOur biggest challenge was getting the data into the desired format. We got the data as a pdf file from NUPD, which proved more inconvenient that we had thought.\r\nWe became intimately familiar with pdf layout and formatting standards (or lack thereof) and spent a lot of time tweaking our parser to correctly scrape the data. This slowed down our progress immensely because it blocked progress on the analysis itself. \r\n\r\nOur other big challenge was the unavailability of data from other schools. We excitedly considered doing similar analyses on other local universities, but we were unable to get a hold of any useful datasets, with the notable exception of MIT. \r\n\r\n### Blue Sky\r\nGiven unlimited funds and time, there's a few angles we'd love to explore with this project\r\n\r\n1. Look at other local universities' safety reports. Compare incidence frequency and time.\r\n\r\n2. Join NUPD data with BPD and explore the difference in types and frequency of reports made to BPD around Northeastern\r\n\r\n3. Visualize locations with an actual heatmap, overlaid over a map of Boston. \r\n\r\n4. Add interactivity to enable specific analysis across the different data types.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDan Rhim - Incidents, Locations, Disposition\r\n\r\nTevin Otieno - Parsing, Heatmap, Time\r\n",
