<p>Campus safety is a crucially important yet often overlooked part of college life. Especially once students are already in university, safety is often discussed big-picture. It's not uncommon to hear platitudes like "Columbus Ave is sketchy at night". Our project aims to quantitatively explore crime and safety on Northeastern University's campus by analyzing data from the Northeastern University Police Department incident reports. </p>

<h3>
<a id="data-collection" class="anchor" href="#data-collection" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Collection</h3>

<p>Huntington News, Northeastern's campus paper, publishes a weekly "Crime Log" with select incident reports throughout the week. These are available <a href="http://huntnewsnu.com/category/crime-log/">online</a> dating back to 2002. Initially, we intended to scrape the data off Northeastern's website, but we quickly scrapped that idea due to the inconsistent formatting and difficulty involved in accurately parsing the logs. 
We decided to reach out to NUPD and request a digital copy of the data. After an office visit and a few not-so-frictionless phone calls, they sent over incident reports from 1st Jan 2016 to  2nd Dec 2016. 
The reports were in a pdf, which we used <a href="https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula">tabula</a> and a python script to extract into a usable CSV. </p>

<h3>
<a id="incidents" class="anchor" href="#incidents" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Incidents</h3>

<p>The first thing we explored was the different <em>types</em> of incident reports. </p>

<p>We were surprised to see how precise these incident reports were, as we found a count of 132 unique incidents reported on campus in 2016. Some of the most frequent reports were incidents regarding suspicious activity, well being or people on campus, medical, drugs, and larceny. </p>

<p>An unexpected observation we found was that there was a high number of incidents of “Well Being - Elevator Entrapment.” We did not expect this at all, and it seems that it was reported so commonly that it had received its own incident name, as opposed to being categorized under “Well Being Check.” </p>

<p>On the other hand, at the bottom of the list there were few incidents regarding aggravated assault and sex crimes, which was a bit surprising. </p>

<p>According to a study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, about 21% of undergraduate females had come across sexual assault some time in their college life. However, this crime log data shows that there were few reports of sex crimes, which could mean that many people are afraid to speak up about it. In an <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/11/03/student-sues-northeastern-over-handling-sexual-assault-case/3pGiXpweQ3VXkDgRUMrYiM/story.html">article</a> by the Boston Globe, Mark F. Itzkowitz, an attorney for an alleged sex crime victim, had said that sex crimes were under-reported on the Northeastern University campus. </p>

<p>Next, we had looked into which areas on campus had reported more or less crimes. 
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/YiKA9jQ.png" alt="Locations"></p>

<p>We saw that over the past year, there were 208 different locations that had reported incidents, but most of the incidents were reported off campus, which had reported almost three times the amount of the second-most reported area, Columbus Place. </p>

<p>We also found that out of the student dorms, Speare Hall had reported the most crimes. We found that, regarding student dorms, the amount of incidents reported widely varies between each dorm, having found anywhere from 8 reports (Kerr Hall) to 97 reports (Speare Hall)</p>

<p>We also made a heatmap to visualize the frequency of specific incidents at the most reported locations. </p>

<p>As expected, the "busiest" hours are at night, starting around 10PM and peaking at 1AM, with a steady drop until the early morning, which boasts the least number of reports.</p>

<p>We also looked at daily number of reports over the entire year
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/XuLzU4g.png" alt="Frequency Year"></p>

<p>There's a huge spike in reports around the end of March/Beginning of April, which we thought might align with the nice weather and the end of midterm season. 
There's a lull in the summer, as there's usually less people on campus around that time. Another spike occurs at the beginning of the semester around September, when everyone is back on campus. </p>

<h3>
<a id="disposition" class="anchor" href="#disposition" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Disposition</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZTvJe3S.png" alt="Disposition">
We had found that there were only 19 dispositions regarding the incidents. The overwhelming majority of dispositions had been under either “Report filed” or “Services Rendered/No Report.” This shows us that most of the incidents reported are actually no big deal and can be dealt with very easily. There were also a low number of arrests made by the Boston Police Department at Northeastern, and an even lower amount of incidents that had been closed by state police, which is to be expected. We had found it surprising that there were almost 300 incidents that had nothing filed under “Disposition.”</p>

<h3>
<a id="challenges" class="anchor" href="#challenges" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges</h3>

<p>Our biggest challenge was getting the data into the desired format. We got the data as a pdf file from NUPD, which proved more inconvenient that we had thought.
We became intimately familiar with pdf layout and formatting standards (or lack thereof) and spent a lot of time tweaking our parser to correctly scrape the data. This slowed down our progress immensely because it blocked progress on the analysis itself. </p>

<p>Our other big challenge was the unavailability of data from other schools. We excitedly considered doing similar analyses on other local universities, but we were unable to get a hold of any useful datasets, with the notable exception of MIT. </p>

<h3>
<a id="blue-sky" class="anchor" href="#blue-sky" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blue Sky</h3>

<p>Given unlimited funds and time, there's a few angles we'd love to explore with this project
1. Look at other local universities' safety reports. Compare incidence frequency and time.
2. Join NUPD data with BPD and explore the difference in types and frequency of reports made to BPD around Northeastern
3. Visualize locations with an actual heatmap, overlaid over a map of Boston. 
4. Add interactivity to enable specific analysis across the different data types.</p>
